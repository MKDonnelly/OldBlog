Hello, world!  This post kicks off the start of my blog about computer science, cyber security, philosophy, and so many other topics I find an interest in.  

However, you would think I would be the last guy to start something like this that requires a significant amount of writing.  A short history of my experience in writing would look something like this:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Me in high school writing: I hate writing!  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Me in writing at junior college: No more!  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Me in writing at UC Davis: Yeah, last writing class!  



But now I intend to write quite often on this blog, and have fun doing it!  So why do I think that my writing experience will be any different?

Looking back, it is easy to see how these two contradictory views are not contradictory at all.  The idea is simple: passion.  In college, I wrote about whatever the instructor told me to write about, topics I had 0 interest in (one time I had to write a paper on an old I Love Lucy video for crying out loud!).  But when my heart is into what I am doing, writing comes naturally and effortlessly.

In the short amount of time that I have been alive in this crazy world, there is one observation I have seen time and time again: those who are best in their field -- whether business, computer science, or mathematics -- are those that are most passionate.  I have yet to come across a person that hated their work, but were the best of the best.  Doesn't happen often, if at all.

My passion lies in computer science, and in particular cyber security.  While I have many other interests that will appear from time to time on this blog, the main topics you will see are computer science and cyber security.  

I am passionate about these areas, and spend a considerable amount of my free time pursuing knowledge in the field.  It is my intention that by writing down my thoughts on topics I am learning in the form of blog posts, I will be able to consolidate my understanding.  In addition, this creates a reference for me to lookup what I have done if needed in the future.  

It is also my hope that the subject I write about are of interest to many of my peers, and that someone is able to learn from what I write about and futher pursue interesting topics I may touch on.
